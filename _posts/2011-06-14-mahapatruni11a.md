title: 'CAKE: Convex Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation'
abstract: In this paper we present a generalization of kernel density estimation called
  Convex Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation (CAKE) that replaces single bandwidth
  se- lection by a convex aggregation of kernels at all scales, where the convex aggregation
  is allowed to vary from one training point to another, treating the fundamental
  problem of heterogeneous smoothness in a novel way. Learning the CAKE estimator
  given a training set reduces to solving a single con- vex quadratic programming
  problem. We derive rates of convergence of CAKE like estimator to the true underlying
  density under smoothness assumptions on the class and show that given a sufficiently
  large sample the mean squared error of such estimators is optimal in a minimax sense.
  We also give a risk bound of the CAKE estimator in terms of its empirical risk.
  We empirically compare CAKE to other density estimators proposed in the statistics
  literature for handling heterogeneous smoothness on different synthetic and natural
  distributions.  [pdf][supplementary]
