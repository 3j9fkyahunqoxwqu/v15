title: A Spike and Slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine
abstract: We introduce the spike and slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine, characterized
  by having both a real-valued vector, the slab, and a binary variable, the spike,
  associated with each unit in the hidden layer.  The model possesses some practical
  properties such as being amenable to Block Gibbs sampling as well as being capable
  of generating similar latent representations of the data to the recently introduced
  mean and covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We illustrate how the spike and
  slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine achieves competitive performance on the CIFAR-10
  object recognition task.    [pdf]
