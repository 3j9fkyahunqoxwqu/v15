title: The Discrete Infinite Logistic Normal Distribution for Mixed-Membership Modeling
abstract: 'We present the discrete infinite logistic normal distribution (DILN, ``"Dylan""),
  a Bayesian nonparametric prior for mixed membership models. DILN is a generalization
  of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) that models correlation structure between
  the weights of the atoms at the group level. We derive a representation of DILN
  as a normalized collection of gamma-distributed random variables, and study its
  statistical properties. We consider applications to topic modeling and derive a
  variational Bayes algorithm for approximate posterior inference. We study the empirical
  performance of the DILN topic model on four corpora, comparing performance with
  the HDP and the correlated topic model.  '
