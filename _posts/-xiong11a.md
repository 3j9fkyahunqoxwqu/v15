title: Hierarchical Probabilistic Models for Group Anomaly Detection
abstract: Statistical anomaly detection typically focuses on finding individual data
  point anomalies. Often the most interesting or unusual things in a data set are
  not odd individual points, but rather larger scale phenomena that only become apparent
  when groups of data points are considered. In this paper, we propose two hierarchical
  probabilistic models for detecting such group anomalies. We evaluate our methods
  on synthetic data as well as astronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
  The experimental results show that the proposed models are effective in detecting
  group anomalies. [pdf][supplementary]
