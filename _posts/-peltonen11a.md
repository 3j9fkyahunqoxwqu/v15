title: Generative Modeling for Maximizing Precision and Recall in Information Visualization
abstract: Information visualization has recently been formulated as an information
  retrieval problem, where the goal is to find similar data points based on the visualized
  nonlinear projection, and the visualization is optimized to maximize a compromise
  between (smoothed) precision and recall. We turn the visualization into a generative
  modeling task where a simple user model parameterized by the data coordinates is
  optimized, neighborhood relations are the observed data, and straightforward maximum
  likelihood estimation corresponds to Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE). While
  SNE maximizes pure recall, adding a mixture component that ``explains away'' misses
  allows our generative model to focus on maximizing precision as well. The resulting
  model is a generative solution to maximizing tradeoffs between precision and recall.
  The model outperforms earlier models in terms of precision and recall and in external
  validation by unsupervised classification. [pdf][supplementary]
