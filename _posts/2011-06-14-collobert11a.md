title: Deep Learning for Efficient Discriminative Parsing
abstract: We propose a new fast purely discriminative algorithm for natural language
  parsing, based on a ``deep'' recurrent convolutional graph transformer network (GTN).
  Assuming a decomposition of a parse tree into a stack of ``levels'', the network
  predicts a level of the tree taking into account predictions of previous levels.
  Using only few basic text features, we show similar performance (in F1 score) to
  existing pure discriminative parsers and existing ``benchmark'' parsers (like Collins
  parser, probabilistic context-free grammars based), with a huge speed advantage.
