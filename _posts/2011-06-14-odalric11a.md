title: 'Adaptive Bandits: Towards the best history-dependent strategy'
abstract: 'We consider multi-armed bandit games with possibly adaptive opponents.
  We introduce models Theta of constraints based on equivalence classes on the common
  history (information shared by the player and the opponent) which define two learning
  scenarios: (1) The opponent is constrained, i.e. he provides rewards that are stochastic
  functions of equivalence classes defined by some model theta* ∈Theta. The regret
  is measured with respect to (w.r.t.) the best history-dependent strategy. (2) The
  opponent is arbitrary and we measure the regret w.r.t. the best strategy among all
  mappings from classes to actions (i.e. the best history-class-based strategy) for
  the best model in Theta. This allows to model opponents (case 1) or strategies (case
  2) which handles finite memory, periodicity, standard stochastic bandits and other
  situations. When Theta=theta, i.e. only one model is considered, we derive tractable
  algorithms achieving a tight regret (at time T) bounded by \tilde O(\sqrtTAC), where
  C is the number of classes of θ.  Now, when many models are available, all known
  algorithms achieving a nice regret O(\sqrtT) are unfortunately not tractable and
  scale poorly with the number of models |Θ|. Our contribution here is to provide
  tractable algorithms with regret bounded by T^2/3C^1/3\log(|Θ|)^1/2. [pdf][supplementary]'
