title: A conditional game for comparing approximations
abstract: 'We present a ``conditional game'''' to be played between two approximate
  inference algorithms. We prove that exact inference is an optimal strategy and demonstrate
  how the game can be used to estimate the relative accuracy of two different approximations
  in the absence of exact marginals.  '
