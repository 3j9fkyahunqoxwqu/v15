title: Online Learning of Structured Predictors with Multiple Kernels
abstract: Training structured predictors often requires a considerable time selecting
  features or tweaking the kernel. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) sidesteps this issue
  by embedding the kernel learning into the training procedure. Despite the recent
  progress towards efficiency of MKL algorithms, the structured output case remains
  an open research front. We propose a family of online algorithms able to tackle
  variants of MKL and group-LASSO, for which we show regret, convergence, and generalization
  bounds. Experiments on handwriting recognition and dependency parsing attest the
  success of the approach. [pdf][supplementary]
