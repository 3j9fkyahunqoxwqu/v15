title: Approximate inference for the loss-calibrated Bayesian
abstract: We consider the problem of approximate inference in the context of Bayesian
  decision theory. Traditional approaches focus on approximating general properties
  of the posterior, ignoring the decision task – and associated losses – for which
  the posterior could be used. We argue that this can be suboptimal and propose instead
  to loss-calibrate the approximate inference methods with respect to the decision
  task at hand. We present a general framework rooted in Bayesian decision theory
  to analyze approximate inference from the perspective of losses, opening up several
  research directions. As a first loss-calibrated approximate inference attempt, we
  propose an EM-like algorithm on the Bayesian posterior risk and show how it can
  improve a standard approach to Gaussian process classification when losses are asymmetric.
