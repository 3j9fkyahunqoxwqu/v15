title: Generalization Bound for Infinitely Divisible Empirical Process
abstract: "In this paper, we study the generalization bound for an empirical process
  of samples independently drawn from an infinitely divisible (ID) distribution, which
  is termed as the ID empirical process. In particular, based on a martingale method,
  we develop deviation inequalities for the sequence of random variables of an ID
  distribution. By applying the obtained deviation inequalities, we then show the
  generalization bound for ID empirical process based on the annealed Vapnik- Chervonenkis
  (VC) entropy. Afterward, according to Sauer√¢\x80\x99s lemma, we get the generalization
  bound for ID empirical process based on the VC dimension. Finally, by using a resulted
  result bound, we analyze the asymptotic convergence of ID empirical process and
  show that the convergence rate of ID empirical process can reach O((\\frac{\\Lambda_\\mathcal{F}(2N)}{N})^{\\frac{1}{1.3}})
  and it is faster than the results of the generic i.i.d. empirical process (Vapnik,
  1999) [pdf][supplementary]"
