title: Linear-Time Estimators for Propensity Scores
abstract: 'We present linear-time estimators for three popular covariate shift correction
  and propensity scoring algorithms: logistic regression(LR), kernel mean matching(KMM),
  and maximum entropy mean matching(MEMM). This allows applications in situations
  where \emph{both} treatment and control groups are large. We  also show that the
  last two algorithms differ only in their choice of regularizer ($\ell_2$ of the
  Radon Nikodym derivative vs. maximum entropy). Experiments show that all methods
  scale well.  [pdf]'
