title: Error Analysis of Laplacian Eigenmaps for Semi-supervised Learning
abstract: 'We study the error and sample complexity of semi-supervised learning by
  Laplacian Eignmaps at the limit of infinite unlabeled data. We provide a bound on
  the error, and show that it is controlled by the graph Laplacian regularizer. Our
  analysis also gives guidance to the choice of the number of eigenvectors k to use:
  when the data lies on a d-dimensional domain, the optimal choice of k is of order
  (n/\log(n))^\fracdd+2, yielding an asymptotic error rate of (n/\log(n))^-\frac22+d.
