title: Error Analysis of Laplacian Eigenmaps for Semi-supervised Learning
abstract: 'We study the error and sample complexity of semi-supervised learning by
  Laplacian Eignmaps at the limit of infinite unlabeled data. We provide a bound on
  the error, and show that it is controlled by the graph Laplacian regularizer. Our
  analysis also gives guidance to the choice of the number of eigenvectors $k$ to
  use: when the data lies on a $d$-dimensional domain, the optimal choice of $k$ is
  of order $(n/\log(n))^{\frac{d}{d+2}}$, yielding an asymptotic error rate of $(n/\log(n))^{-\frac{2}{2+d}}$.
