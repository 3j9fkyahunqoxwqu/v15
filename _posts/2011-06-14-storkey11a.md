title: Machine Learning Markets
abstract: Prediction markets show considerable promise for developing flexible mechanisms
  for machine learning. Here, machine learning markets for multivariate systems are
  defined, and a utility-based framework is established for their analysis. It is
  shown that such markets can implement model combination methods used in machine
  learning, such as product of expert and mixture of expert approaches as equilibrium
  pricing models, by varying agent utility functions. They can implement models composed
  of local potentials, and message passing methods. Prediction markets also allow
  for more flexible combinations, by combining multiple different utility functions.  [pdf]
