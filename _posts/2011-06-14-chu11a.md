title: Contextual Bandits with Linear Payoff Functions
abstract: In this paper we study the contextual bandit problem (also known as the
  multi-armed bandit problem with expert advice) for linear payoff functions.  For
  T rounds, K actions, and d dimensional feature vectors, we prove an O(\sqrtTd\ln^3(KT\ln(T)/δ))  regret
  bound that holds with probability 1-δfor the simplest known (both conceptually and
  computationally) efficient upper confidence bound algorithm for this problem.  We
  also prove a lower bound  of Ω(\sqrtTd) for this setting, matching the upper bound
  up to logarithmic factors. [pdf]
