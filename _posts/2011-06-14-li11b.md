title: Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion Strategy for On-Line Portfolio Selection
abstract: This paper proposes a novel on-line portfolio selection strategy named ``Confidence
  Weighted Mean Reversion'' (CWMR). Inspired by the mean reversion principle and the
  confidence weighted online learning technique, CWMR models a portfolio vector as
  Gaussian distribution, and sequentially updates the distribution by following the
  mean reversion trading principle. The CWMR strategy is able to effectively exploit
  the power of mean reversion for on-line portfolio selection. Extensive experiments
  on various real markets demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in comparison
  to the state of the art. [pdf]
