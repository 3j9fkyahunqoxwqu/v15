title: Estimating Probabilities in Recommendation Systems
abstract: Modeling ranked data is an essential component in a number of important
  applications including recommendation systems and web-search. In many cases, judges
  omit preference among unobserved items and between unobserved and observed items.
  This case of analyzing incomplete   rankings is very important from a practical
  perspective and yet has   not been fully studied due to considerable computational   difficulties.
  We show how to avoid such computational difficulties   and efficiently construct
  a non-parametric model for rankings with   missing items. We demonstrate our approach
  and show how it applies in the context of collaborative filtering. [pdf]
