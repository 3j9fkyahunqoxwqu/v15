title: Fast Convergent Algorithms for Expectation Propagation Approximate Bayesian
  Inference
abstract: We propose a novel algorithm to solve the expectation propagation relaxation
  of Bayesian inference for continuous-variable graphical models. In contrast to most
  previous algorithms, our method is provably convergent. By marrying convergent EP
  ideas from (Opper&Winther, 2005) with covariance decoupling techniques (Wipf&Nagarajan,
  2008; Nickisch&Seeger, 2009), it runs at least an order of magnitude faster than
  the most common EP solver. [pdf]
