title: 'Unsupervised Supervised Learning II: Margin-Based Classification without Labels'
abstract: Many popular linear classifiers, such as logistic regression, boosting,
  or SVM, are trained by optimizing margin-based risk functions. Traditionally, these
  risk functions are computed based on a labeled dataset. We develop a novel technique
  for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and knowledge of p(y). We prove
  that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional datasets and
  demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the
  estimate is used for evaluating classifiers in transfer learning, and for training
  classifiers using exclusively unlabeled data. [pdf]
