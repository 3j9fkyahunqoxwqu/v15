title: Spectral Clustering on a Budget
abstract: Spectral clustering is a modern and well known method for performing data
  clustering. However, it depends on the availability of a similarity matrix, which
  in many applications can be non-trivial to obtain. In this paper, we focus on the
  problem of performing spectral clustering under a budget constraint, where there
  is a limit on the number of entries which can be queried from the similarity matrix.
  We propose two algorithms for this problem, and study them theoretically and experimentally.
  These algorithms allow a tradeoff between computational efficiency and actual performance,
  and are also relevant for the problem of speeding up standard spectral clustering.
