title: Estimating beta-mixing coefficients
abstract: The literature on statistical learning for time series assumes the asymptotic
  independence or ``"mixing"'' of the data-generating process.  These mixing assumptions
  are never tested, nor are there methods for estimating mixing rates from data. We
  give an estimator for the beta-mixing rate based on a single stationary sample path
  and show it is L1-risk consistent. [pdf]
