title: Learning equivalence classes of acyclic models with latent and selection variables
  from multiple datasets with overlapping variables
abstract: While there has been considerable research in learning probabilistic graphical
  models from data for predictive and causal inference, almost all existing algorithms
  assume a single dataset of i.i.d. observations for all variables. For many applications,
  it may be impossible or impractical to obtain such datasets, but multiple datasets
  of i.i.d. observations for different subsets of these variables may be available.
  Tillman et al. (2009) showed how directed graphical models learned from such datasets
  can be integrated to construct an equivalence class of structures over all variables.
  While their procedure is correct, it assumes that the structures integrated do not
  entail contradictory conditional independences and dependences for variables in
  their intersections. While this assumption is reasonable asymptotically, it rarely
  holds in practice with finite samples due to the frequency of statistical errors.
  We propose a new correct procedure for learning such equivalence classes directly
  from the multiple datasets which avoids this problem and is thus more practically
  useful. Empirical results indicate our method is not only more accurate, but also
  faster and requires less memory.
