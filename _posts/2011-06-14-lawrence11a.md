title: Spectral Dimensionality Reduction via Maximum Entropy
abstract: 'We introduce a new perspective on spectral dimensionality reduction which
  views these methods as Gaussian random fields (GRFs). Our unifying perspective is
  based on the maximum entropy principle which is in turn inspired by maximum variance
  unfolding. The resulting probabilistic models are based on GRFs. The resulting model
  is a nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis. We show that parameter
  fitting in the locally linear embedding is approximate maximum likelihood in these
  models. We develop new algorithms that directly maximize the likelihood and show
  that these new algorithms are competitive with the leading spectral approaches on
  a robot navigation visualization and a human motion capture data set.  '
