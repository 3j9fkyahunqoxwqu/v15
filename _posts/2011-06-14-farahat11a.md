title: A novel greedy algorithm for NystrÃ¶m approximation
abstract: The NystrÃ¶m method is an efficient technique for obtaining a low-rank approximation
  of a large kernel matrix based on a subset of its columns. The quality of the NystrÃ¶m  approximation
  highly depends on the subset of columns used, which are usually selected using random
  sampling. This paper presents a novel recursive algorithm for calculating the NystrÃ¶m
  approximation, and an effective greedy criterion for column selection. Further,
  a very efficient variant is proposed for greedy sampling, which works on random
  partitions of data instances. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that the proposed
  greedy algorithms achieve significant improvements in approximating kernel matrices,
  with minimum overhead in run time. [pdf][supplementary]
