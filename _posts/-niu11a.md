title: Dimensionality Reduction for Spectral Clustering
abstract: Spectral clustering is a flexible clustering methodology that is applicable
  to a variety of data types and has the particular virtue that it makes few assumptions
  on cluster shapes. It has become popular in a variety of application areas, particularly
  in computational vision and bioinformatics. The approach appears, however, to be
  particularly sensitive to irrelevant and noisy dimensions in the data. We thus introduce
  an approach that automatically learns the relevant dimensions and spectral clustering
  simultaneously. We pursue an augmented form of spectral clustering in which an explicit
  projection operator is incorporated in the relaxed optimization functional. We optimize
  this functional over both the projection and the spectral embedding. Experiments
  on simulated and real data show that this approach yields significant improvements
  in the performance of spectral clustering. [pdf]
