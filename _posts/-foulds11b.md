title: A Dynamic Relational Infinite Feature Model for Longitudinal Social Networks
abstract: Real-world relational data sets, such as social networks, often involve
  measurements over time. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric latent feature model
  for such data, where the latent features for each actor in the network evolve according
  to a Markov process, extending recent work on similar models for static networks.
  We show how the number of features and their trajectories for each actor can be
  inferred simultaneously and demonstrate the utility of this model on prediction
  tasks using both synthetic and real-world data. [pdf]
